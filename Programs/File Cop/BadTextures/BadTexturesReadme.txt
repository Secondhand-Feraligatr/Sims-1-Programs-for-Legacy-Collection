The Sims File Cop will put bad texture bitmaps in this folder. You can fix them by opening them in a paint program and changing them to 256 color. If you do that you can return them to your game.
  This is done by first checking the file size ... 
if 193 kb then they are in wrong color format. 
Click start > programs > accessories > paint .... 
once open click on File > open ...  
then move to the right folder. 
C:\program files\Maxis\The Sims File Cop\BadTextures\
Click on the file name that is wrong format  .... 
then click open ..
once the funny looking .bmp is open (yes that is a skin file) ... 
Click File > Save-as > change the file type to 256 color leaving the file name as it is and click save .... 
Repeat this for any other large .bmp files in there 
Once you have corrected the files you will see them as 66 kb files and they can be moved back to the Skins folder
