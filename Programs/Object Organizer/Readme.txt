Overview
--------
The Sims Hot Date Object Organizer allows you to set objects created by The Sims Art Studio and other programs so they sort correctly in the catalog and are available for purchase Downtown.

1. Make sure the objects you want to change are in GameData\UserObjects.

2. Run The Sims Hot Date Object Organizer.

3. Select the object you want to change. The .iff filename will appear in the window to the left. Some tools can create .iff files with more than one object in them. Select the object in the .iff file in the window next to the .iff filename.

4. The current sorts will be filled in for that object. By default all Function Subsorts are set to none. This means they only appear in the All subsort. Select the new subsort here. By default the object will not be available for purchase downtown. In Downtown Buy mode an object can appear under different categories. Check the box next to all the categories you want that object available under.

5. Click on Save. The object will now be available in Hot Date.

6. Note that if the selection boxes are grayed that object is not available for buy mode. Objects can NOT be available in both build and buy mode. Build mode objects can not be changed to buy mode. After setting these sorts these objects will still function normally in earlier versions of the game. Setting these sorts does NOT mean this object requires Hot Date.
