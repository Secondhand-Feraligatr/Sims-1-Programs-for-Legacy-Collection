## **Troubleshooting**
- **16 bit color error**

Art Studio needs 16 bit color mode while Homecrafter needs 16 bit color mode and xp service pack 2 compability mode. You getting a 16 bit color mode error means the installer failed to apply these atrributes. So, you'll have to go into the properties of the exe and apply them manually.

- **Uninstalling**

In your sims 1 installation you'll find a file called `unins000.exe`. Running this will uninstall all of the sims 1 programs from this installer.
